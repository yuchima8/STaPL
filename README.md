# STaPL Tillage Map in the U.S.

![alt text](https://github.com/yuchima8/STaPL/blob/main/Fig4_STAPL_Tillage_Maps.png)

This is the homepage to host the STaPL tillage maps, which are generated based on a scale transfer framework Scale Transfer with Pseudo-Labeling (STaPL).

# Data Coverage

The annual STaPL tillage maps include 30-m tillage types (low-intensity and high-intensity) for corn and soybean cropland in 2001-2023. The maps cover 12 states in the U.S. Midwest, including Illinois (IL), Indiana (IN), Iowa (IA), Kansas (KS), Michigan (MI), Missouri (MO), Minnesota (MN), Nebraska (NE), North Dekota (ND), Ohio (OH), South Dekota (SD), Wisconsin (WI). 


The map is generated by year and by state. Each map has two bands. The first band __"classification"__ stores the tillage types, in which 0 means __"high-intensity tillage"__ and 1 means __"low-intensity tillage"__. The second band __"LS_count"__ stores the number of available Landsat observations at the pixel.

The map is named by the year and the state. For example, the STaPL map in Iowa in 2022 is named as __"IA_2022_STAPL"__.

# Data Availability

The methodology paper on STaPL is under review. The STaPL maps will be available on Google Earth Engine (GEE) after paper publication. The 2022 STaPL maps are available now for review. To use the map, access the target map in GEE by: 

```javascript
var STaPL_map = ee.Image('projects/lobell-lab/US_tillage_2024/STAPL_maps/' + image_name)
```

For example, if you want to use the tillage map in Iowa (IA) in 2022, the code should be like:

```javascript
var STaPL_map_IA_2022 = ee.Image('projects/lobell-lab/US_tillage_2024/STAPL_maps/IA_2022_STAPL')
```
